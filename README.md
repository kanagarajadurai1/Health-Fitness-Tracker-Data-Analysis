# Health-Fitness-Tracker-Data-Analysis

The goal of this project is to analyze physical activity and sleep patterns using data collected from fitness trackers (e.g., Fitbit, Apple Watch). The objective is to:
Gain insight into user lifestyle habits
Discover correlations between sleep, activity, and calories burned
Identify trends that can help in promoting healthier routines

Key Questions Explored:
Are users meeting the recommended step and activity levels?
What’s the relationship between activity level and calories burned?
How does sleep quality relate to daily activity?
Which days of the week are people most active?

Tools & Technologies Used:
Python for analysis and data cleaning
Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
(Optional) Plotly for interactive visualizations

Project Workflow:
✅ 1. Data Preprocessing:
Converted date columns to datetime format
Removed duplicates and ensured valid numeric entries
Added new columns: day of the week, activity categories, etc.

✅ 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Step and sleep distribution histograms
Correlation heatmap between all numerical metrics
Box plots for activity levels by day
Time-series plots for calorie trends

✅ 3. Key Visualizations:
📈 Steps vs Calories Burned
🛏️ Sleep vs Step Count
🗓️ Activity Trends by Day of the Week
🔥 Top Calorie-Burning Days

Insights Gained:
Users who sleep more than 7 hours tend to walk more and burn more calories.
Friday and Sunday show higher physical activity levels.
VeryActiveMinutes are strongly correlated with calories burned.
Many users spend too much time in a sedentary state, even if they hit their step goals.

Recommendations:
Encourage users to track sleep regularly and compare it with performance.
Promote weekend workout challenges to boost consistency.
Develop a personalized notification system for prolonged inactivity.
Suggest intensity-based activity plans to maximize calorie burn.

Use Cases:
Health & wellness startups building lifestyle recommendation engines
Insurance companies analyzing fitness for dynamic health plans
Personal trainers offering data-backed fitness advice
Academic research on human behavior & wellness trends
